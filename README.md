# Fudo
Welcome to our culinary social networking site! Here you can enjoy new images of scrumptuous food on a regular basis, upload and share new recipes, and experience a whole new world of food. 

## Steps to run locally

### Step 1
Once you clone the repository, enter the fudo directory and run the 'npm install' command. 

### Step 2
Execute by running 'npm start' within the fudo directory. Note that if you attempt to activate the site outside the fudo directory, the package.json must be in the same directory that the 'npm start' command is run in. 

Also note that the start path in package.json must be adjusted to be able to successfully find the www file.
